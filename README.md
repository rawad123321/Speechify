Speechify is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) Chrome extension created by Rawad to help language learners, individuals with visual impairments such as dyslexia, and anyone who prefers listening over reading.

Users can select any text on a webpage, right-click, and choose "Speechify" to have the selected text read aloud. The extension also includes controls to pause, resume, or stop the speech at any time using the buttons on the extension toolbar.

In addition, Speechify displays a translation of the selected text. If you want to listen to the translated text, simply click on Read Translation. You can also customize the reading experience by changing the language or the voice according to your preference.
